# 🧩 PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Bank Loan Analysis using Power BI

Financial institutions manage large volumes of loan data involving applications, disbursements, repayments, interest rates, and borrower risk indicators.
Without a consolidated analytical system, it becomes difficult to:

* Monitor loan performance effectively
* Identify good and bad loans
* Track repayment trends
* Assess borrower risk across regions, purposes, and demographics

This project aims to design an **interactive Power BI dashboard solution** that provides **clear, data-driven insights** into bank loan performance and supports **better lending decisions**.
